# Monocraft 

My 2020 - 2021 Compsci Coursework / final project. This project contributed towards my A-level.

This is a 3D sandbox game written in c# using the monogame framework. 

This repo was made by someone inexperienced with github. 

To Future Tom: 
If you're trying to run this, you probably want VS2019, Monogame installed & open the code by running Monocraft/Monocraft.csproj
